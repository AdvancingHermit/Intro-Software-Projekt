Made by s236137, s235285, s235278 and s235281.

SnakeGame.jar is run by using the command <code>java -jar SnakeGame.jar</code> in the files directory to start the program.

If the game is run on mac, the command is this instead. <code>java -XstartOnFirstThread -jar SnakeGame.jar</code>

It has only been tested on JDK 17 and later.
